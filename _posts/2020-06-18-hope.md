What is the best thing to have faith in? Is it a person or is it an animal? You might argue that it's your skills you can have faith in or maybe it's the guts because you can't even have faith in anything if you have no guts. Honestly, I am a person with no guts. I am more afraid of everything you can ever think of. Not that I'm a coward and not because I'm afraid of death but because I have nothing to have my faith upon. You might question again: Is it really that important to have faith upon something? Can one live without faith, without hope, without light, without shadow? Not that you give a damn but you know what I think? A person having no faith is a hopeless one and hope is something that we live for. We live hoping that we will eventually lead a life greater than we have lived up to now. We live hoping that we get that thing we wanted so badly. You might have hoped less and that's why I can see you so happy, even in the smallest of things. I have hoped for something that I cannot achieve even with all my might. Am I hopeless? Is it that I am too coward to have my faith in something that I am hopeless? 

No, that is my sadness taking over. In fact, there is the slightest hope in everything. Every step you take, every decision you make, there is a hope that something better will come off it and eventually to you too. That hope is what keeps us alive. As Andy Dufresne taught us "_Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies"_. Don't ever let go of that last strand of why you wanted to do it so badly at first. It might turn out into something pretty cool you know ;)
